# Light_Intensity_data_analysis


### Imagine you're trying to track how an object is moving—whether it's coming closer, moving away, or staying still—but instead of directly observing it, you're relying on changes in light intensity (in lux) measured by a sensor. 

### My approach is to analyze the rate of change in the light intensity to detect whether the object is approaching, moving away, or remaining stationary. This gives us a clear, data-driven way to classify movement based on sensor readings.
